// ! create Ui that shows 9 divs as a box display player names and in the end of the game display who won, create resetGame button 
// ? add function to swap playermode if player1 has more tiles then player2 and the oter way 
// * give every boardgame element exact position in the array. Start with array of 0-8. reasign exact element's value to chosen symbol onclick 
// ! add function that checks for a pattern of symbols in the array e.g. arr[0,3,6] (I know that doesnt work but it's good for me to visualize) === "X" means win. Also is a vertical line on the left side of the board etc. 
// ? array.lenght == 8 && all other pattern checking functions return false - display draw. display the resetGame button 
// * add factory function that creates objects of player with name, X/O symbol 
// ! add module for functions that checks for a patterns of symbols in array. 
// ? create resetGame() that resets symbols in the array to 0-8, keep names of players and resets dom

const arr = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
